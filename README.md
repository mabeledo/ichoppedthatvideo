=== I chopped that video! ===

This is some code I wrote some years ago for something that never took off.
Honestly, I don't think it worked properly. I didn't have any experience in
massive, high performance, oh-my-god-this-is-awesome client-server programming
and was the only engineer working on it, plus setting up databases, servers
and so on. Yes, I was the little bitch of someone richer.

Apologies aside, doing this taught me some interesting things about how the
ffmpeg suite works because, back in the day, documentation was almost non
existant, how to test if the client bandwith is not enough to stream HD video
(this is what I called the 'god' code because, you know, I didn't believe in
it), some thingies about openssl...

I forgot almost everything, thank FSM, because as hard as I worked, spending
days, nights and weekends, I did so little money I couldn't afford insomnia,
stress and my girlfriend leaving me, that's how pityful it was. So I quitted.
I lost a remarkable amount of money because, you know, it was better to quit
as soon as I can and stop worrying than torture myself for a check, but
my code, that was signed and licensed under the GPL license (yes man, I
didn't trust you after that week you called telling me that you couldn't
afford my fee... from a vacation resort) was copied in a dirty little disk.

Anyway, this code remained buried until now.

Maybe someone finds it useful.
